# Project: College Clean Up 

# DH150 Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation by Cortney Chow

The community I want to join with my UX Design is my demographic, college students ages 18-24. I want my skills to be catered to a group that needs streamlined advice or information about moving out, organizing, time management, cooking, cleaning, and more. This project will also help college students with their food and groceries as it will show nearby restaurants open near them, link the app to grocery services like Instacart or Target Grocery Pick Up or Delivery, and weekly coupons for nearby grocery markets or retail stores. Thus, by examining the websites Cleanipedia and Wise Guys Pie, I can combine information about cleaning and living with the information of a local restaurant to see what my project should accomplish. 

# Information About Website for the First Heuristic Evaluation:
Weblink: [Cleanipedia](https://www.cleanipedia.com/gb/home.html) 

<img width="1680" alt="Cleanepedia Home Page" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72332282-9e65de00-366e-11ea-8568-35327ecf87ca.png">

The website is a housekeeping encyclopedia powered by Unilever that functions as a database for basic housecleaning articles, essentials, and tips. My motivation for using Cleanipedia was to see how a housekeeping database can be improved for the average college student and what information or categories could be condensed or omitted. As this will relate back to my project, I wanted to examine Cleanipedia for its design, content, customer service, and accessibility to users. My initial evaluation of this website was that the design was aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate. However, there were major aspects missing such as an "About Page," "Contact Page," Search Bar, and design consistency between different web pages.

# Heuristic Evaluation 

**1: Visibility of System Status**
 
 a) Only feedback that users can give regarding the website is a thumbs down or thumbs up for the helpfulness of an article. Users cannot share any comments about the articles but use the thumbs up and thumbs down system which is a weak method of feedback between users and the system because it is vague. It is difficult for users to actually give construtive criticism or voice their concerns regarding problems with the site.

b) Does not enable users to recieve feedback on how long an article will take to load or how long an article will be. For example, there is a "read more" icon for users to click in order to read the article but does not specify the length of the article. Thus, users may find it difficult to find all the information at once and does not inform the reader how concise or lenghy the article may be.

c) The website does allow users to see how many articles there are in each category/tab. Therefore, users will know the number of articles they are viewing and how many articles there are in total.

*Severity Rating:*

**2: Match Between System and Real World**

a) The website uses familiar jargon when categorizing the different types of housekeeping such as Kitchen Cleaning, Laundry, Bathroom, and more. However, there are unncessary categories that overlap with one another, making it difficult to find specific articles you want to view as you may have to go through multiple tabs. For example, if I want to know how to organize my medicine cabinet should I go to the tab "In the Home" or "Kitchen Cleaning"? This is example is applicable to the everyday user as categories that may have similarities can make it harder for users to access the information.

*Severity Rating:*
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**3: User Control and Freedom**

a) Users are able to exit articles quickly by either clicking “Cleanipedia” for the homepage, backspace in the browser, clicking recommended articles at the end of the web page, or by clicking on other categories in the tool bar above. This makes it so users can access other articles and informatiom with ease as there are many ways to leave a web page.

*Severity Rating:*
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**4:Consistency and Standards**

a) The website does not have a consistent design template with each category. If a user clicks the "Baby" Tab, it changes the template of the website and gives you icons such as the search button and menu button which is not available on the homepage or the website's other tabs.

Standard Website Template:

Inconsistent Web Page: 

b) No typical “About Us” or “FAQ” tab. User has to scroll down to the bottom of the website with small text to know what company runs this website or click on the “Privacy Policy” or “Legal Notice” to know more about the website. This is not the  typical way to find information or contact those that run the site. Although there is company name at the bottom of the site, there is not a link to the company and no more information about who is producing the content or web design. 



c) However, the website does underline links with different color (blue) which is consistent with a user's experience.

*Severity Rating:*
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**5:Error Prevention**

a) The website has restraints on what users can look up and tries its search system (although it does not work) recommends words to prevent misspelling or offer suggestions 

b) The whole website restricts what users can do and what content is available so the website is mostly user error free. You cannot create an account and the search button does not work. Thus, users are limited to the articles in the website.

c) The option to join the mailing list by clicking the "Sign Up" button does not work and will not tell users why it does not work as the web page will remain stagnant and not to an error page. 

*Severity Rating:*
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**6:Recognition Rather Than Recall**

a) There is a 404 error when searching for items in the search bar which is accessed in the baby category. For example, I searched the word cat and nothing appeared. 

b) Although the search bard does not work, it still has the function of auto fill which makes it easier for users to filter out information and makes it easier for users to recognize things they want to search

*Severity Rating:*
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**7:Flexibility and Efficienty of Use**

a) The only shortcuts are the tabs in the tool bar that will guide users to tailored information based on the categories

b) The search bar does not work so users will still have to filter out hundreds of articles to find something specific 

c)  Difficult to cater to “expert” users as there are not functions that can make it easier for an experienced user to find articles quickly such as a “Favorites” function. There are no other tailoring options besides the tool bar tabs so this website design is not flexible and only has one format for novice and experienced users

*Severity Rating:*
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**8:Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**

a) Aesthetically designed as it is not too cluttered. Minimalistic design that uses negative space and simplistic designs to make the articles the focal point, not the design 


*Severity Rating:*
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


**9:Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, & Recover Rrom Errors**

a) Sign up button does not work and will not give users an error or help page on why you cannot sign up for their mailing list

b) 404 error encountered through search bar 

*Severity Rating:*
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**10:Help and Documentation**

a) The search tool does not work and cannot perform functions that will be helpful to users

b) There is no contact us page, no help page, no FAQ form-- thus, no guidance for the user

c) Users do not know who runs the page, do not have people to contact about the information and to not have platforms to review the website
