# Project: College Clean Up 

# DH150 Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation by Cortney Chow

The community I want to join with my UX Design is my demographic, college students ages 18-24. I want my skills to be catered to a group that wants streamlined advice or information about moving out, organizing, time management, cooking, cleaning, and more. This project will also help college students with their food and groceries as it will show nearby restaurants open near them, link the app to grocery services like Instacart or Target Grocery Pick Up or Delivery, and weekly coupons for nearby grocery markets or retail stores.
