# Project: College Clean Up 

# DH150 Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation by Cortney Chow

The community I want to join with my UX Design is my demographic, college students ages 18-24. I want my skills to be catered to a group that needs streamlined advice or information about moving out, organizing, time management, cooking, cleaning, and more. This project will also help college students with their food and groceries as it will show nearby restaurants open near them, link the app to grocery services like Instacart or Target Grocery Pick Up or Delivery, and weekly coupons for nearby grocery markets or retail stores. Thus, by examining the websites Cleanipedia and Wise Guys Pie, I can combine information about cleaning and living with the information of a local restaurant to see what my project should accomplish. 

# Information About Website for the First Heuristic Evaluation:
Weblink: [Cleanipedia](https://www.cleanipedia.com/gb/home.html) 

<img width="1680" alt="Cleanepedia Home Page" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72332282-9e65de00-366e-11ea-8568-35327ecf87ca.png">

The website is a housekeeping encyclopedia powered by Unilever that functions as a database for basic housecleaning articles, essentials, and tips. My motivation for using Cleanipedia was to see how a housekeeping database can be improved for the average college student and what information or categories could be condensed or omitted. As this will relate back to my project, I wanted to examine Cleanipedia for its design, content, customer service, and accessibility to users. My initial evaluation of this website was that the design was aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate. However, there were major aspects missing such as an "About Page," "Contact Page," Search Bar, and design consistency between different web pages.

# Heuristic Evaluation 

**1: Visibility of System Status**
 
 a) Only feedback that users can give regarding the website is a thumbs down or thumbs up for the helpfulness of an article. Users cannot share any comments about the articles but use the thumbs up and thumbs down system which is a weak method of feedback between users and the system because it is vague. It is difficult for users to actually give constructive criticism or voice their concerns regarding problems with the site. 

<img width="821" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-13 at 10 26 07 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72333753-31077c80-3671-11ea-83e8-3a05b2b6b34c.png">

b) Does not enable users to receive feedback on how long an article will take to load or how long an article will be. For example, there is a "read more" icon for users to click in order to read the article but does not specify the length of the article. Thus, users may find it difficult to find all the information at once and does not inform the reader how concise or lengthy the article may be. 

<img width="1045" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-13 at 10 32 06 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72334340-00741280-3672-11ea-80f6-b94019251e7e.png">

c) The website does allow users to see how many articles there are in each category/tab. Therefore, users will know the number of articles they are viewing and how many articles there are in total.

<img width="453" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-13 at 10 27 26 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72350028-7a1bf880-3692-11ea-81ae-e10c7c664d22.png">

*Severity Rating:* 3
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**2: Match Between System and Real World**

a) The website uses familiar jargon when categorizing the different types of housekeeping such as Kitchen Cleaning, Laundry, Bathroom, and more. However, there are unnecessary categories that overlap with one another, making it difficult to find specific articles you want to view as you may have to go through multiple tabs. For example, if I want to know how to organize my medicine cabinet should I go to the tab "In the Home" or "Kitchen Cleaning"? This is example is applicable to the everyday user as categories that may have similarities can make it harder for users to access the information. 

<img width="1556" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-13 at 10 39 06 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72335575-08cd4d00-3674-11ea-86f3-f433c93e64b6.png">


*Severity Rating:* 1
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**3: User Control and Freedom**

a) Users are able to exit articles quickly by either clicking “Cleanipedia” for the homepage, backspace in the browser, clicking recommended articles at the end of the web page, or by clicking on other categories in the tool bar above. This makes it so users can access other articles and information with ease as there are many ways to leave a web page. 

<img width="327" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-13 at 10 47 22 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72335300-9a888a80-3673-11ea-865b-2499aefd6ff2.png">

*Severity Rating:* 0
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**4:Consistency and Standards**

a) The website does not have a consistent design template with each category. If a user clicks the "Baby" Tab, it changes the template of the website and gives you icons such as the search button and menu button which is not available on the homepage or the website's other tabs.

Standard Website Template:

<img width="1292" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-14 at 3 14 25 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72339898-03740080-367c-11ea-9880-00c96a890f20.png">


Inconsistent Web Page: 

<img width="1203" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-13 at 10 55 45 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72339838-ea6b4f80-367b-11ea-882e-b0a2cea65771.png">

b) No typical “About Us” or “FAQ” tab. User has to scroll down to the bottom of the website with small text to know what company runs this website or click on the “Privacy Policy” or “Legal Notice” to know more about the website. This is not the  typical way to find information or contact those that run the site. Although there is company name at the bottom of the site, there is not a link to the company and no more information about who is producing the content or web design. 

<img width="862" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-13 at 10 50 41 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72339933-1be41b00-367c-11ea-9e19-3d07d6d97887.png">

c) However, the website does underline links with different color (blue) which is consistent with a user's experience.

<img width="790" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-13 at 10 48 02 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72339956-21416580-367c-11ea-847c-925c6a6e4e3a.png">

*Severity Rating:* 3
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**5:Error Prevention**

a) The website has restraints on what users can look up and tries its search system (although it does not work) recommends words to prevent misspelling or offer suggestions 

<img width="752" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-13 at 11 11 54 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72340441-13d8ab00-367d-11ea-8350-2de600a8c3dd.png">

b) The whole website restricts what users can do and what content is available so the website is mostly user error free. You cannot create an account and the search button does not work. Thus, users are limited to the articles in the website.

c) The option to join the mailing list by clicking the "Sign Up" button does not work and will not tell users why it does not work as the web page will remain stagnant and not to an error page.

<img width="1209" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-13 at 10 34 38 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72340543-3ff42c00-367d-11ea-863e-9ab2c31656f6.png">



*Severity Rating:* 2
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**6:Recognition Rather Than Recall**

a) There is a 404 error when searching for items in the search bar which is accessed in the baby category. For example, I searched the word "cat" and nothing appeared. 

<img width="1509" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-13 at 10 57 26 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72340465-1d621300-367d-11ea-99d7-b3b1ba043e0f.png">

b) Although the search bar does not work, it still has the function of auto fill which makes it easier for users to filter out information and makes it easier for users to recognize things they want to search

<img width="752" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-13 at 11 11 54 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72340441-13d8ab00-367d-11ea-8350-2de600a8c3dd.png">

*Severity Rating:* 0
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**7:Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**

a) The only shortcuts are the tabs in the tool bar that will guide users to tailored information based on the categories

b) The search bar does not work so users will still have to filter out hundreds of articles to find something specific 

c)  Difficult to cater to “expert” users as there are not functions that can make it easier for an experienced user to find articles quickly such as a “Favorites” function. There are no other tailoring options besides the tool bar tabs so this website design is not flexible and only has one format for novice and experienced users

*Severity Rating:* 3
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**8:Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**

a) Aesthetically designed as it is not too cluttered. Minimalistic design that uses negative space and simplistic designs to make the articles the focal point, not the design 

<img width="1680" alt="Cleanepedia Home Page" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72332282-9e65de00-366e-11ea-8568-35327ecf87ca.png">


*Severity Rating:* 0
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


**9:Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, & Recover From Errors**

a) Sign up button does not work and will not give users an error or help page on why you cannot sign up for their mailing list

<img width="1209" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-13 at 10 34 38 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72340543-3ff42c00-367d-11ea-863e-9ab2c31656f6.png">

b) 404 error encountered through search bar 

<img width="1509" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-13 at 10 57 26 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72340465-1d621300-367d-11ea-99d7-b3b1ba043e0f.png">

*Severity Rating:* 1
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**10:Help and Documentation**

a) The search tool does not work and cannot perform functions that will be helpful to users

b) There is no contact us page, no help page, no FAQ form-- thus, no guidance for the user

c) Users do not know who runs the page, do not have people to contact about the information and to not have platforms to review the website

<img width="862" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-13 at 10 50 41 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72339933-1be41b00-367c-11ea-9e19-3d07d6d97887.png">

# Information About Website for the Second Heuristic Evaluation:
Weblink: [Wise Guys Pies](http://www.wiseguyspies.com/index.html) 

<img width="1206" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-14 at 5 43 15 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72349235-f7df0480-3690-11ea-870e-14b7926d7ffc.png">


The website is created for a local pizza company named Wise Guys Pies. This website includes photos, menus, specials, their location, and other interactive activities like surveys. My motivation for using Wise Guys Pies was to examine how a local restruant can interact and appeal to the demands of its customers through their website. Because my project includes working with Westwood's local restaurants for students, evaluating this website will help me identify how to market food to a specific demographic such as creating promotional deals for students.As this will relate back to my project, I wanted to examine Wise Guys Pies for its design, accessibilty, and customer service. My initial evaluation of this website was that the design was old fashioned, unorganized, and unappealing to users. There are also major aspects missing such as an "About Page," " Search Bar," and design consistency between different web pages.

# Heuristic Evaluation 

**1: Visibility of System Status**
 
 a) Feedback that users can give regarding the website is signing into their online guest book and leaving comments. However, there is only one comment in the book and lacks visibilty to other users. This is also located in the "Extras/Specials" tab rather than a "Help" or "About" page.  Because of this placement, it can make it difficult for a user to leave a comment as it is not located in a more sensible part of the website. 
 
 <img width="284" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-14 at 5 43 48 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72349508-7e93e180-3691-11ea-8ea2-dfb75fce8655.png">
 


b) Feedback also occurs by contacting them through the website if you leave your email, name, and message. This is easy to access with users as it is found on the home page. However, there is no guarentee of response as there is no time frame given for the system to get back to the user. 


<img width="305" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-14 at 12 48 26 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72349241-fad9f500-3690-11ea-86ea-9713487df11f.png">


c)Feedback also comes in the form of a survey about the users' favorite pie. Users are given options about their favorite pies from that restaurant and other users' can see the responses. However, this is also located in the "Extras/Specials" tab rather than a "Help" or "About" page. Because of this placement, it can make it difficult for a user to leave a comment as it is not located in a more sensible part of the website.  

<img width="311" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-14 at 4 13 34 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72350041-8011d980-3692-11ea-97f9-708d7592562d.png">


*Severity Rating:* 2
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**2: Match Between System and Real World**

a) The website uses familiar langauge related to pizza and most American menus. However,there is a repeated category of "specialty pizzas" which can be confusing to the user as the tabs, although similarly labeled, have different menus.

<img width="1046" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-14 at 4 14 04 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72349516-8489c280-3691-11ea-8efd-9fa3065d61d9.png">






*Severity Rating:* 1
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**3: User Control and Freedom**

a) Users can exit out of external web links from the website such as the user poll 

<img width="508" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-14 at 4 15 24 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72349512-80f63b80-3691-11ea-9679-dffebd376129.png">


b) Users can navigate the site with ease as there is a “home" button in the menu. There are also categories such as "PASTA/SALADS" which will take you to a different part of the menu. 

<img width="1046" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-14 at 4 14 04 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72349516-8489c280-3691-11ea-8efd-9fa3065d61d9.png">



c) Because the website is being used on a browser, using the “back button” and “x” button to leave the site makes it easy for users to have more control.

<img width="587" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-14 at 5 53 54 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72350054-843df700-3692-11ea-9b52-92e19ae685f9.png">




*Severity Rating:* 0
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**4:Consistency and Standards**

a) The website does not have a consistent design template with each category. If a user clicks the "Hoagies & Wedgies" Tab, they will be presented with a pdf of the menu. However, if the user clicks "DESSERTS/DRINKS" the menu becomes font on a screen (not a pdf). This makes it difficult for the user to navigate and understand the website as it lacks in consistency. 

HOAGIES/WEDGIES MENU:

<img width="1046" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-14 at 4 14 04 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72349516-8489c280-3691-11ea-8efd-9fa3065d61d9.png">

DESSERTS/DRINKS MENU:

<img width="1213" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-14 at 12 49 47 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72349536-8eabc100-3691-11ea-8797-590006f0e812.png">


b) No “About Us” or “FAQ” category. Although there is information about the restaurant like the phone number and address, there is not statement from the business or their history as an establishment. This information can be important to consumers as this can answer questions about ingredients and why it is a credible establishment. 

<img width="1206" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-14 at 5 43 15 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72349235-f7df0480-3690-11ea-870e-14b7926d7ffc.png">

c) The "home" button remains consistent to a users expectations as it is used to go back to the main menu. This can make the user more familiar with the site. 

<img width="1046" alt="Screen Shot 2020-01-14 at 4 14 04 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623113/72349516-8489c280-3691-11ea-8efd-9fa3065d61d9.png">




*Severity Rating:* 3
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**5:Error Prevention**

a) When you want to submit a message through "Contact Us," in order for the company to get back to you they need your email thus, there is a prevention that says "please fill the required feidls" if any are left empty. 

b) In the survey for a user's favorite pie, you can submit your answer without filling in an answer. However, the vote is not counted so the number remains accurate.

c) In the survey for a user's favorite pie, the system prevents you from selecing more than one option as this would skew results. 

*Severity Rating:* 0
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**6:Recognition Rather Than Recall**

a) The toolbar may be easier for users to understand as the menu is broken up into typical categories that pizza and Italian food are subject to. However, the website does not make things easier for the user as there is no search bar, past order history, or other functions that help make ordering easier for the users. Instead, they have to recall what they ordered last time or remember what section of the menu has their favorite foods. 

*Severity Rating:* 3
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**7:Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**

a) The only shortcuts are the tabs in the tool bar that will guide users to food categories

b) There is no search bar so users will have to look over the whole menu to find what they would like to order

c)  Difficult to cater to “expert” users as there are not functions that can make it easier for an experienced user to find food items quickly such as a “Favorites” function. There are no other tailoring options besides the tool bar tabs so this website design is not flexible and only has one format for novice and experienced users

*Severity Rating:* 3
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**8:Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**

a) The design is not appealing to consumers and appears to be out-of-date. The design is too cluttered and unorganized. This can be difficult to the user as he/she/they will have to spend more time and effort to look over the menu. There is also a repeat category of "Specialty Pizzas" which adds to the unorganization of the design

*Severity Rating:* 3
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


**9:Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, & Recover From Errors**

a) When you want to submit a message through "Contact Us," in order for the company to get back to you they need your email thus, there is a prevention that says "please fill the required feidls" if any are left empty. 

b) The website does not know when an email is valid or not, thus, fake emails can pass through the system undetected in the "Contact Us" page 



*Severity Rating:* 1
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**10:Help and Documentation**

a) There is minimal guidance as there is a "Contact Us" form but no active feedback between the system and the user. There is also no "FAQ" or "About Section" which aids in helping users that need instruction or answers to questions. 

b) There is no search bar so it is difficult for users to find specific items they want on a menu as it has been seperated into 8 categories. Thus, a user who is no familiar with the site may have to go through all these tabs in order to see if the menu has what he/she/they are looking for.
