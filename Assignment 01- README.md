# Project: College Clean Up 

# DH150 Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation by Cortney Chow

The community I want to join with my UX Design is my demographic, college students ages 18-24. I want my skills to be catered to a group that needs streamlined advice or information about moving out, organizing, time management, cooking, cleaning, and more. This project will also help college students with their food and groceries as it will show nearby restaurants open near them, link the app to grocery services like Instacart or Target Grocery Pick Up or Delivery, and weekly coupons for nearby grocery markets or retail stores. Thus, by examining the websites Cleanipedia and Wise Guys Pie, I can combine information about cleaning and living with the information of a local restaurant to see what my project should accomplish. 

# Information About Website for the First Heuristic Evaluation:
Weblink: [Cleanipedia](https://www.cleanipedia.com/gb/home.html)

The website is a housekeeping encyclopedia powered by Unilever that functions as a database for basic housecleaning articles, essentials, and tips. My motivation for using Cleanipedia was to see how a housekeeping database can be improved for the average college student and what information or categories could be condensed or omitted. As this will relate back to my project, I wanted to examine Cleanipedia for its design, content, customer service, and accessibility to users. My initial evaluation of this website was that the design was aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate. However, there were major aspects missing such as an "About Page," "Contact Page," Search Bar, and design consistency between different web pages.

# Heuristic Evaluation 

**1: Visibility of System Status**
 
 a) Only feedback that users can give regarding the website is a thumbs down or thumbs up for the helpfulness of an article. Users cannot share any comments about the articles but use the thumbs up and thumbs down system which is a weak method of feedback between users and the system because it is vague. It is difficult for users to actually give construtive criticism or voice their concerns regarding problems with the site.

b) Does not enable users to recieve feedback on how long an article will take to load or how long an article will be. For example, there is a "read more" icon for users to click in order to read the article but does not specify the length of the article. Thus, users may find it difficult to find all the information at once and does not inform the reader how concise or lenghy the article may be.

c) The website does allow users to see how many articles there are in each category/tab. Therefore, users will know the number of articles they are viewing and how many articles there are in total.

**2: Match Between System and Real World**

a) The website uses familiar jargon when categorizing the different types of housekeeping such as Kitchen Cleaning, Laundry, Bathroom, and more. However, there are unncessary categories that overlap with one another, making it difficult to find specific articles you want to view as you may have to go through multiple tabs. For example, if I want to know how to organize my medicine cabinet should I go to the tab "In the Home" or "Kitchen Cleaning"? This is example is applicable to the everyday user as categories that may have similarities can make it harder for users to access the information.

**3: User Control and Freedom**

a) Users are able to exit articles quickly by either clicking “Cleanipedia” for the homepage, backspace in the browser, clicking recommended articles at the end of the web page, or by clicking on other categories in the tool bar above. This makes it so users can access other articles and informatiom with ease as there are many ways to leave a web page.
